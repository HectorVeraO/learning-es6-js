The Babel tutorial teaches you to "compile" ES6 code
into ES5 code.

First you need to install Babel
Set up where your compiled code will be placed,
  dist in the example,
  src contains ES6 code,
  and write the babel scripts to compile your code
  in the package.json file.
Write your ES6 code
Run the build script.
