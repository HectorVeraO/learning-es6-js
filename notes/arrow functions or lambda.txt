Arrow function expression, they have a shorter syntax than a function expression, and they do not have their own "this", arguments, or new.target.
These function expressions are best suited for non method functions, and they cannot be used as constructors.

Again the lack of their own "this" is pretty useful another thing is given that "this" comes fromt he surrounding lexical context,
"strict mode" rules with regards to "this" are ignored.
