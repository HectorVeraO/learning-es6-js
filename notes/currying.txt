Currying is when a function doesn't take all of its arguments upfront, instead
it wants you to give it the first argument and then the function returns another function, which
you are supposed to call with the second argument which will return another function that
you're supposed to call with the third argument which in turn will return another function and so on
until the last argument is received and then and the function at the end of the chain will be the one
to return the value that you actually want.
