some new String methods are
startsWith(string)
endsWith(string)
includes(string)

they are pretty self explanatory, for detailed info check the doc

some new Number methods are
isFinite(number)
isNaN(arg)
isInteger(number)

again check the doc

ES6 also includes a special notation for numbers in different bases,
such as hexadecimal

for hexadecimal numbers use the prefix
0x
for binary numbers use the prefix
0b
for octal number use the prefix
0o

you can even use those prefixes inside template literals,
just use them as if they were variables, e.g.

`The number: ${0xFFF}`

which should be The number: 4095
