WeakMap

The Set structure lets you store unique values of any type, whether primitive values or object references.

The Map structure holds key-value pairs. Any value (both object and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value.

The WeakSet structure lets you store weakly held objects in a collection, they are a collection of objects ONLY.

The WeakMap structure is a collection of key-value pairs in which the keys are weakly referenced. The keys must be objects and the values can be arbitraty values.

What does "weakly held" mean?
That there isn't another reference to an object so they can be garbage collected.
