the class keyword defines the blueprint for a type, it can have
attributes and methods (functions).

the extends keyword allows you to "inherit" to a class every single
element of the parent class, example class A has x attribute and
class B has y attribute and class B extends from class A then
class B also has the x attribute, methods are also inherited.

there are some other keywords like static which allow you to
define a method that can be called without an instance of the class

the super keyword allows you to call the parent class methods,
when you'll call super make sure to call it before any this keyword in scope
